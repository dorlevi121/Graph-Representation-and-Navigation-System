# Graph representation and graph navigation system

The graph representation and graph navigation system is actually 2 OOP projects.  
Graph Representation System - The system allows the user to construct directed graphs and manipulate the graphs using graph algorithms. The whole system support UI.  
Graph Navigation Game -Game with maps from Ariel city in Israel (the maps represented as graphs), robots and fruits on them.   
The goal of this game is to eat as many fruits as possible in the given time (30 or 60 seconds).

## Graph Representation System

### Features
- Create and add vertices;
- Create and add edges;
- Build a directed and weighted graph;
- Initialize a graph from file;
- Saves the graph to a file.;
- Saves the graph as a picture.;
- Check if the graph is connected;
- Check the length of the shortest path between 2 vertices;
- Computes a relatively short path which visit each node in the a list;
